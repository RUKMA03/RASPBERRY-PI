# RASPBERRY-PI
This repository contains Python code extracted from multiple PDF files related to Raspberry Pi programming and embedded systems.

File Structure
The extracted code has been divided into 20 parts across five units:

Unit 1: Basic Python Programming
unit1_part1.py
unit1_part2.py
unit1_part3.py
unit1_part4.py
Unit 2: Motor Control and Interrupts
unit2_part1.py
unit2_part2.py
unit2_part3.py
unit2_part4.py
Unit 3: Sensors and GPS Integration
unit3_part1.py
unit3_part2.py
unit3_part3.py
unit3_part4.py
Unit 4: Measuring Temperature & Distance Sensors
unit4_part1.py
unit4_part2.py
unit4_part3.py
unit4_part4.py
Unit 5: Web Applications & IoT (CherryPy & MQTT)
unit5_part1.py
unit5_part2.py
unit5_part3.py
unit5_part4.py
Description
Each file contains Python scripts for various embedded system functionalities, including:

Basic Python syntax and operations
Controlling motors using PWM and H-Bridge
Working with sensors like PIR, GPS, DS18B20, and ultrasonic sensors
Web applications using CherryPy
IoT communication using MQTT

Notes
Some files may require running with superuser privileges (sudo python script.py).
Ensure Raspberry Pi GPIO connections are correct before running scripts involving hardware.
